# Assignment 14.1 - Key Learning Goal & Task

## **Task**
In this lab, the goal is to gain proficiency in utilizing built-in functions to obtain user input effectively. You will learn how to interact with users through input prompts and capture their responses using Python's built-in functions.

## **Key Learning Goals:**
- Understand the purpose and functionality of built-in functions for user input.
- Learn how to prompt users for input using Python's `input()` function.
- Practice capturing and processing user-provided data within your programs.

## **Tasks to Complete:**

| TODO | Task to Complete |
|------|-----------------|
| 1 | Ask for user input using 'word' and save response in a string variable `function`. |
| 2 | Ask for user to input a keyword and save response into a string variable `input_keyword`. |
| 3 | Ask for input and save response into string variables `code`, `input_start`, and `input_end`. |
| 4 | Ask for input and save response into a string variable `graph_choice`. The types of `graph_choice` can be found in the functional requirements inside the overall project manual. |
| 5 | Ask user to input moving average frequency and save response into an integer variable `ma`. |
| 6 | Ask for user input using 'next_word' and save response in a string variable `next_step`. |

---

## **Instructions**
1. Implement a Python script that prompts the user for the required inputs.
2. Store the responses in their respective variables.
3. Ensure that the script runs without errors and correctly captures the user input.
4. Validate integer inputs where necessary (e.g., `ma`).
