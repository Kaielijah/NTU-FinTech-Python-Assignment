# Hints for Flowchart 2

## **Understanding the Flowchart Logic**
To check whether a graph is required, you may consider whether the index for the graph is inside the `graph_choice`. For example, the **volume graph** is required if `'8'` is in `graph_choice`.

### **Implementation Guidelines**
- Your main task is to **implement the logic** for the loops and branches, which correspond to the **rhombus (decision) items** in the flowchart.
- For all the **square (process) items** in the flowchart, which define actions taken within branches, you may simply **write them as comments** and they will be implemented in future blocks.
- **Print messages** at designated places where actions are performed. These messages will help in testing whether the loops and branches work correctly.
- You may design your own printed messages as long as they align with the flowchart logic.
